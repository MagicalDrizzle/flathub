    <p>
      This is yet another firmware downloader for Samsung devices, but it has some special features.
      For one, it's cross-platform. Bifrost runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and even Android!
      Bifrost is also a graphical program, with a shared UI across all supported platforms.
      Most of the functionality in Bifrost is based on Samloader. The Python code has been converted to Kotlin and tweaked to take advantage of some of Kotlin's features.
      Bifrost uses Jetpack Compose, JetBrains Compose for Desktop, and Kotlin Multiplatform to create a shared codebase for all supported platforms.
